### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sebastian Munaretto, and I am an Italian computer science student. I am very interested in machine learning and data science with python, but I also develop web app mostly with the MEAN stack but also in PHP and raw HTML CSS and JS. I sometimes code desktop apps in Java, mobile apps in Flutter/Dart and more scientific stuff in C or in python.
