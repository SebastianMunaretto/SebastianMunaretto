### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sebastian Munaretto, a passionate computer science student from Italy with a strong interest in machine learning and data science using Python. However, I don't limit myself to just one field, as I also love developing web apps using the MEAN stack, as well as utilizing my skills in PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS. Sometimes I enjoy dabbling in desktop app development using Java or building mobile apps with Flutter/Dart. On occasion, I even like to delve into more scientific areas, using C or Python. With a strong curiosity and willingness to learn, I'm always excited to take on new challenges and projects!
