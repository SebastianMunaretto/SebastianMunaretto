### Hi there 👋
My name is Sebastian Munaretto, and I am an Italian computer science student. I am very interested in machine learning and data science with python, but I also develop web apps mostly with the MEAN stack but also in PHP and raw HTML CSS and JS. I sometimes develop desktop apps in Java, mobile apps in Flutter/Dart or code more scientific stuff in C or in python.
